                Located in the heart of Kremmling, Colorado, Big Shooter Coffee
                is the perfect place to stop on your way to Steamboat, back to Denver, or if you need a treat! <br><br>
                Owners Stephanie and Shawn Scoll have been serving those who live and travel through Grand County for
                over 20 years and it's their mission to provide a top quality product and service. <br><br>
                We recycle our coffee grounds. We purchase eco-friendly paper products. We are currently looking into
                acquiring solar panels to heat our water, and photovoltaic panels for
                electricity.We shop locally as much as possible, and try to spend money in as many
                different businesses as available.<br><br>
                Additionally, we work closely with the community and encourage local shopping. We can partner with your
                business or any community based
                function and some of our profits will be donated to local schools.<br><br>
                Come in, play some games, drink some coffee, take a picture with our bear, and relax for a
                while!<br>
